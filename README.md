# CNN-Xray-Pneumonia-Detection
Attempt at creating a CNN classifier for Pneumonia Detection in X-rays. \
This project is using the dataset publicly avialable at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nih-chest-xrays/data).
As this is a very challenging classification task even for humans, I therefore do not expect this model to perform well, especially with limited training. It is an example however how common computer vision techniques can be applied to medical data.
